Coincheck security features include storage of customer assets in cold wallets, working with information security firms and two-factor authentication for users.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2018, $530 million worth of NEM (XEM) tokens were stolen in a hack of the exchange. This was due to Coincheck being short staffed and suffering technical difficulties, resulting in poor security practices.

ParaSwap raised seed funding from the likes of Blockchain Capital, Alameda Research, Arrington XRP Capital, Coinfund and Stani Kulechov.\n\nParaswap is a trading platform and [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) aggregator that caters to traders across country borders, with a focus on exchanging [Ethereum transaction](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-transaction) tokens and allowing [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) exchanges to take place while offering other [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) services within its exchange portal. Besides [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), Paraswap also supports [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) and [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/).\n\nIn essence, Paraswap acts as the intermediary between users and various DeFi services, collating [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) from more than 20 decentralized exchanges to bring all these possibilities into a single portal for users’ convenience.\n\n\n## What Is Paraswap?\n\nParaSwap is a DeFi-based exchange portal that is user-friendly and designed with the user’s convenience in mind.\n\nEach Paraswap transaction shows the user a helpful summary of their transaction, including the estimated cost, price impact and minimum received. Also shown are the routing details to help users understand the path their tokens have taken and minimize confusion. \n\nOne important thing to note is that Paraswap exchanges do not incur any additional fees to the user and users only need to pay for [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas), as with any DeFi exchange. \n\nParaswap returns the optimal route and effective price to the end-user through a series of routing through its internal mechanisms. Once a user taps into the exchange, Paraswap finds the best rate using a pricing aggregator that fetches off-chain pricing and then performs the swap using a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to deposit the fee into a fee wallet. This may sometimes involve breaking a single order into several exchanges if that is the most price-efficient way of conducting the swap. \n\nThis mechanism eliminates the need for users to compare prices and instead frees up their time to focus on optimizing their trading strategy or educating themselves on the cryptocurrency space, like using [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\nThe “Swap & Transfer” function allows users to easily send tokens to other users at any address, facilitating cross-party exchanges.\n\n\n# How Does Paraswap Work?\n\nUsing ParaSwap begins with an Ethereum wallet, which is all a user needs in order to make use of the exchange.\n\nTo set up an account, a user can use the Paraswap app on a browser or download the Paraswap app. They can then use a [hot wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/10-best-crypto-hot-wallets-for-beginners), like MetaMask, or a [cold wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/best-crypto-cold-wallets), like the Ledger Nano. Users need to then create an Ethereum account on Ledger Live. In Ledger Live, there is a Swap tab where a user needs to select Paraswap as the provider.\n\nFrom here, the user can select the Ethereum account they want to use as well as the tokens they want to swap. The last step is verifying the swap information on their Ledger hardware wallet. \n\n\n# What Makes Paraswap Unique?\n\nParaswap is unique firstly in that it allows large transfers of Ethereum to take place, with the transfers most effective when they exceed 15 ETH. Paraswap also allows for transfers involving interactions with a number of DeFi protocols.\n\nAnother unique feature of Paraswap is that it allows users to aggregate their DeFi exchanges and do the swaps within one single transaction, optimizing gas fees. \n\nWhile Ethereum is the main type of token exchanged on Paraswap, the exchange also allows for the payment of different types of currencies, saving a lot of steps for users.","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1159.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://t.me/paraswap"],"website":["https://paraswap.io/#/"],"fee":[],"blog":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/paraswap"]},"tags":null,"type":"","date_launched":null,"is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":5902739.55968982,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":296627,"status":"active"},"1161":{"id":1161,"name":"Bit.com","slug":"bit-com","description":"Launched on 03/08/2020, Bit.com is a centralized derivative exchange based in Seychelles.

These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol.

Unlike any other AMMs, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central limit orderbook meaning that funds deposited into Raydium are converted into limit orders which sit on Serum’s orderbooks. This gives Raydium LPs access to all of Serum’s order flow as well as their existing liquidity.  \nRAY is the native utility token used for:\n\n* Staking to earn protocol fees\n* Staking to receive IDO allocations\n* Governance votes on protocol decisions\n\n\n## How many RAY tokens are in circulation?\n\nRaydium launched its main net on February 21st, 2021 with 555,000,000 tokens created at genesis. 34% of all tokens will be released as liquidity mining incentives over a 3-year period. 30% of tokens are earmarked for partnerships and the expansion of the Raydium ecosystem. This includes giving grants to projects building projects around Raydium or helping our communities in general. These tokens are generally locked for 1 year and unlock linearly for the next 2 years.\n\n### Who are the founders of Raydium Protocol?\nAlphaRay leads overall strategy, operations, product direction and business development for Raydium. With a background in algorithmic trading in commodities, Alpha transitioned to market making and liquidity providing for cryptocurrency in 2017 and hasn't looked back. After diving into DeFi in the summer of 2020, Alpha saw a market need for an order book AMM to aggregate liquidity, and with the release of Serum, pulled together a team of experienced trading developers to tackle the problem head on.\nXRay is Raydium's Chief of Technology and Dev Team leader. X has 8 years of experience as a trading and low latency systems architect for both traditional and crypto markets. X designs all of Raydium’s systems and infrastructure as needed.\nGammaRay heads up marketing and communications while also playing a key role in strategy and product direction. Gamma spent a large part of his career at a leading data analytics and market research firm, working on both client engagements and corporate marketing. Prior to Raydium, Gamma's focus within cryptocurrency has been technical analysis and discretionary trading.\n\n### Where can I buy RAY?\nRAY is available on a growing number of exchanges with cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs currently available.\nThe most liquid exchanges include Raydium.io itself, FTX.com and gate.io","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1342.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://t.me/raydiumprotocol"],"website":["https://raydium.io/"],"fee":[],"blog":["https://raydium.medium.com/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol"]},"tags":[{"name":"Decentralized Exchange","slug":"decentralized-exchange","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"AMM","slug":"amm","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"Solana Ecosystem","slug":"solana-ecosystem","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"swap","date_launched":"2021-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":77437282.45140935,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":1050223,"status":"active"},"1344":{"id":1344,"name":"PancakeSwap (V2)","slug":"pancakeswap-v2","description":"PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain.

After depositing funds the users earn a liquidity provider (LP) token called VENOM-LP which can be staked to earn additional rewards besides trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe LP token is also used by users to reclaim their initial provided capital plus earned trading fees.\r\n\r\n## What Makes ViperSwap Unique?\r\n\r\nViperSwap takes advantage of Harmony's 2-second finality and extremely low transaction fees to offer one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence right now.\r\n\r\nA regular swap transaction on ViperSwap typically costs around $0.0000000015 - making the platform a viable option for everyone since users don't have to pay $10, $20 or even $100 to perform a single swap.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is governed by the VIPER governance token which is HRC-20 token awarded to liquidity providers staking their LP tokens on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe VIPER token features a unique lockup system designed to incentivize long-term protocol participation with the explicit goal of rewarding early and loyal liquidity providers. The token is used for both protocol governance as well as incentivizing liquidity providers.\r\n\r\nSwaps on ViperSwap follow a similar fee model as Uniswap and Sushiswap: every trade carries a 0.3% fee.\r\n\r\nViperSwap features a fee-sharing system called the \"ViperPit\" where 0.1% of the 0.3% fee (1/3rd) is distributed to users staking the VIPER token in the ViperPit single-asset staking pool. This is 50% more than what is awarded to stakers in e.g. SushiSwap (which rewards stakers with 1/6th of trading fees).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n* Super fast DEX\r\n* Insanely low swap fees (as low as $0.0000000015!)\r\n* Attractive fee sharing mechanism rewarding singe-asset stakers 1/3rd of all generated trading fees","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1356.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://t.me/VenomDAO"],"website":["https://viper.exchange"],"fee":[],"blog":["https://venomdao.medium.com/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/venomdao"]},"tags":[{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"","date_launched":"2021-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":4690625.70170034,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":80913,"status":"active"},"1359":{"id":1359,"name":"SpiritSwap","slug":"spiritswap","description":"SpiritSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom Opera Chain that launched April 25, 2021.

User's can trade against a liquidity pool to swap tokens. \r\n\r\nLiquidity on SpiritSwap is incentivized through yield farming.

They allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto tokens, whose prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula. Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes, and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem.\r\n\r\nNow, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) online service that allows direct cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are aimed at solving problems that are inherent in centralized exchanges. They create p2p markets directly on the blockchain, which allows traders to independently store and operating funds. Users of such exchanges can make transactions with cryptocurrency directly between each other — i.e., without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nSo, what about CoinSwap Space? Founded on April 2021, CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. CoinSwap Space uses an automated market maker (AMM) model where users can trade against a liquidity pool. Those pools are filled with users’ funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in exchange. Now, they can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees. \r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space’s vision is to create a strong foundation for the community by giving them incentives in exchange for their support of the AMM model. Creating an advanced ecosystem for automated liquidity provisioned on the Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nWho is our target? Our main target is consumers that are avoiding the high gas fees of Ethereum Blockchain. We are also aiming to become the best platform that you can use that operates in the AMM model of BSC.\r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space also allows users to farm additional tokens that are listed on the yield farming pool. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens, staking them in a process that rewards users with CSS tokens. Users can stake those CSS tokens to receive CSSl, which will have further functionality as a governance and utility token.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CoinSwap Space platform has the ability to launch new pools, as it is an automated market maker that utilizes smart routing that gives its clients the best swapping rate, slippage, and price impact available. \r\n\r\nThe liquidity provided to the swap comes from Liquidity Providers (\"LPs\") who stake their tokens in \"Pools\". In exchange for this, they get CS-LP (CoinSwap-LiquidityProvider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn CSS tokens in the \"farm.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need to know more about CoinSwap Space, more information is available at https://doc.coinswap.space/.","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1398.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://t.me/CoinSwapSpace"],"website":["https://app.coinswap.space/#/dashboard/pairs"],"fee":["https://doc.coinswap.space/overview/fees/swap-transaction-fees"],"blog":["https://coinswap.medium.com/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/CoinSwap_Space"]},"tags":[{"name":"Decentralized Exchange","slug":"decentralized-exchange","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"AMM","slug":"amm","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"","date_launched":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":1291702.56879528,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":5695,"status":"active"},"1400":{"id":1400,"name":"THORChain (BEP20)","slug":"thorchain-bep20","description":"THORChain is the first decentralized exchange (DEX) in the world to enable crosschain trading (i.e. native BTC for native ETH) \n\nhttps://app.thorswap.finance/","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1400.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://discord.gg/Z2x4wj"],"website":["https://thorchain.org/"],"fee":["https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/fees"],"blog":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/THORChain"]},"tags":[{"name":"Decentralized Exchange","slug":"decentralized-exchange","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"AMM","slug":"amm","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"","date_launched":null,"is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":2192725.13757494,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":null,"status":"active"},"1401":{"id":1401,"name":"THORChain (BTC)","slug":"thorchain-btc","description":"THORChain is the first decentralized exchange (DEX) in the world to enable crosschain trading (i.e. native BTC for native ETH) \n\nhttps://app.thorswap.finance/","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1401.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://discord.gg/Z2x4wj"],"website":["https://thorchain.org/"],"fee":["https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/fees"],"blog":[],"twitter":[]},"tags":[{"name":"AMM","slug":"amm","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"","date_launched":null,"is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":2996284.28809276,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":null,"status":"active"},"1404":{"id":1404,"name":"Balancer (V2)","slug":"balancer-v2","description":"Balancer is a non-custodial portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor protocol.

Shiba Inu is a popular dog-themed meme coin that was inspired by the success of Dogecoin and has earned itself the title of “[Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) killer.” Shiba Inu recently [November 2021] managed to briefly surpass Dogecoin in market capitalization, partly thanks to its ShibaSwap exchange. \n\nShibaSwap enables users to provide liquidity and swap different tokens while earning its governance token [BONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bone-shibaswap/) in the process. Users can also trade NFTs, so-called “Shibatoshis,” a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Other functionalities include [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking), [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) tokens, collecting rewards and checking portfolio analytics.\n\n## Who Founded ShibaSwap?\n\nAfter burning half of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, who proceeded to donate his tokens to charity, the Shiba Inu community decided that SHIB would need to set itself apart from other meme coins and started working on ShibaSwap. \n\nSince the founder of Shiba Inu is unknown, the same is true for ShibaSwap. The Shiba Inu community developed the exchange in order to increase the utility of the SHIB token. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by “Ryoshi,” a pseudonymous developer. Shiba Inu’s “Woofpaper” explains three reasons for the creation of Shiba Inu: \n\n* “We started from zero, with zero.”\n* “The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before.”\n* “We love Shiba Inu Dogs.”\n\n## What Makes ShibaSwap Unique?\n\nShibaSwap is a fully functional decentralized exchange with all the functionality of other decentralized exchanges like UniSwap and PancakeSwap. The biggest difference is that all DeFi functions on ShibaSwap are dog-themed and named differently than they would be on a regular exchange. \n\nFor instance, providing liquidity is called “digging” and as a reward, liquidity providers receive ShibaSwap liquidity pool tokens (SSLP). Staking is titled “Bury,” and users can stake all three tokens SHIB, BONE, and LEASH for attractive yield. 33% of bone rewards from staking are available immediately, while the remaining 66% are locked up for six months. Users can also check their “Bonefolio” performance in the “Dogalytics.” “Woofing” returns is to swap SSLP tokens for BONE, the protocol’s governance token. \n\nAs of Oct. 30, 2021, ShibaSwap has an impressive [TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) of $452 million. It also offers two additional tokens to its SHIB coin. BONE is the exchange’s governance token with a total supply of 250 million tokens. BONE holders can propose and vote on changes to the Shiba protocol via its Doggy DAO. LEASH was originally launched as a rebase token, similar to an algorithmic stablecoin. It automatically increased and decreased in supply, while keeping its price pegged to another asset. In the case of LEASH, the price was supposed to track the price of Dogecoin at a rate of 1:1000. The protocol changed this and the price of LEASH is now allowed to float freely. Since there are only 107,647 LEASH, the token acts as a sort of store of value for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Aiming at a top DEX on OKExChain, KSwap Finance enables the seamless transferring of digital currencies among users via a well-developed automatic maker algorithm (AMM). It is also the first to launch products such as KUniverse and KStarter to explore more ways to play and meet the needs of more users.\r\n\r\nKSwap Finance always attaches particular high importance to platform security and functionalities. Its products have been demonstrated to be well-functioned on the test net. Since its launch on the test net as early as February (2021), KSwap Finance has drawn heightened interests from blockchain communities. Only in April, KSwap grows terrifically, with an over 500% increase in total liquidity. An increasing influx of users has chosen to test various mature and new features on Kswap Finance to be better positioned for the official reception of OkExChain.\r\n\r\nWhat makes KSwap Finance different from other AMM-based decentralized changes? \r\n\r\nKSwap Finance is integrated with a marketplace for celestial body-themed non-fungible tokens (NFT), KUniverse. Unlike traditional NFTs that only have collector and game values, KUniverse deeply integrates KSwap's trading and bonus mechanisms, allowing KUniverse NFT holders to participate in a fixed bonus pool for KSwap's transaction fees to receive rewards. \r\n\r\nKUniverse issues a total of 20,000 mystery boxes in which there is a card representing celestial bodies such as Earth, Mars, etc. However, these celestial-themed cards are not equally distributed. Cards featuring different celestial bodies are assigned one of the seven levels of weights. Cards with higher weights are more scarce, and therefore more valuable than those with lower ranks. \r\nTrading in the marketplace. A user may trade his/her NFT assets with different NFT cards by selling in the market. This comes with a great level of flexibility, meaning a user may set whatever price he/she deems reasonable.\r\n\r\nStaking for rewards. KSwap Finance will dedicate a significant amount of the total supply of the KST into a dividend pool. In order to reap as high KST rewards as possible, a user may want to stake NFT cards with higher weights. The weights are used by the pool's algorithm to determine what portion of total rewards out of each block will be given to the user. Another entertaining aspect is that if a user collects a series of NFT cards covering all of the seven levels, the user can enjoy as high as 44% additional bonus when all the cards are stacked in the dividend pool. This design uniquely benefits NFT holders, as by staking their assets they can enjoy passive income along the time.","notice":"","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/exchanges/64x64/1431.png","countries":[],"fiats":[],"urls":{"chat":["https://t.me/kswap_finance"],"website":["https://kswap.finance/"],"fee":[],"blog":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/kswap_finance"]},"tags":[{"name":"Decentralized Exchange","slug":"decentralized-exchange","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"AMM","slug":"amm","group":"PROPERTY"},{"name":"DEX","slug":"dex","group":"PROPERTY"}],"type":"","date_launched":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","is_hidden":0,"is_redistributable":null,"maker_fee":0,"taker_fee":0,"spot_volume_usd":92775049.21908477,"spot_volume_last_updated":"2022-01-22T10:20:15.731Z","weekly_visits":844,"status":"active"},"1432":{"id":1432,"name":"PandaSwap","slug":"pandaswap","description":"PandaSwap is a decentralized exchange running on OKEx Chain, with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.
